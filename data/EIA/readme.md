# US Energy Information Administration

While this may seem redundant to what is already available online, recent initiatives such as [Data Refuge](http://www.ppehlab.org/datarefuge) and the Environmental Data Governance Initiative ([EDGI](https://envirodatagov.org/)) have brought to light how tenuous these sources actually are, especially under the 2017 administration.

### EIA Data Details

note: anything in **_bold italic_** are notes or descriptions I added.

**Data** - description from source, _data period, update date, size._

[**Crude Oil Pipelines**](CrudeOil_Pipelines_US_EIA) - Major crude oil pipelines in the United States. Layer includes interstate trunk lines and selected intrastate lines but excludes gathering lines. Based on publicly available data from a variety of sources with varying scales and levels of accuracy. This layer is not visible if zoomed in beyond 1:1,000,000 scale. _June 2016, updated 7/7/2016, ~77KB._

[**Crude Oil Rail Terminals**](CrudeOil_RailTerminals_US_EIA) - Rail terminals that handle the loading and unloading of crude oil. _As of Nov. 2014, updated 12/15/2014, ~238 KB_

[**Border Crossing, Liquids**](BorderCrossing_Liquids_EIA) - U.S. border crossing points of liquids pipelines. Liquids include crude oil, hydrocarbons, and petroleum products. This layer is not visible if zoomed in beyond 1:35,000 scale. U.S. State Department, Bureau of Energy Resources; public websites and press releases. -  _2016, updated 7/7/2016, ~91 KB._

**[HGL Pipelines](HGL_Pipelines_US_EIA)** - **_Hydrocarbon Gas Liquids_** - Major HGL pipelines in the United States. Layer includes interstate trunk lines and selected intrastate lines. Based on publicly available data from a variety of sources with varying scales and levels of accuracy. This layer is not visible if zoomed in beyond 1:1,000,000 scale. Created by EIA using publicly available data. _June 2016, updated 7/7/2016, ~41 KB_

**[Indian Lands of the United States](indlanp010g.shp_nt00968)** - Areas administered by the Bureau of Indian Affairs.

Indian lands are areas with boundaries established by treaty, statute, and (or) executive or court order, recognized by the Federal Government as territory in which American Indian tribes have primary governmental authority. The Bureau of Indian Affairs is responsible for the administration and management of 55.7 million acres of land held in trust by the United States for American Indians, Indian tribes, and Alaska Natives, and maintains a list of the 562 Federally recognized tribal governments.

The Indian Lands of the United States map layer shows areas of 640 acres or more, administered by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Included are Federally-administered lands within a reservation which may or may not be considered part of the reservation. There may be private inholdings within the boundaries of the Indian lands in this map layer. Descriptive information includes the area name. _December 2014, December 2014, ~2.9 MB_

**[Federal Lands of the United States](fedlanp010g.shp_nt00966)** - Lands owned or administered by the Federal government.

National parks, national wildlife refuges, military reservations, Federal prisons, and public-domain land are all examples of lands owned or administered by the Government of the United States. The Federal Government is responsible for managing and protecting these lands to preserve the resources of the United States, to conduct the business of the Government, and to provide recreational and other opportunities to the public.

The Federal Lands of the United States map layer shows those lands owned or administered by the Federal Government, including the Bureau of Land Management, the Bureau of Reclamation, the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service, the Department of Defense, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the National Park Service, the Tennessee Valley Authority, and other agencies. Only areas of 640 acres or more are included. Descriptive information includes the name and type of the Federal land and the administering agency. There may be private inholdings within the boundaries of the Federal lands in this map layer.

The map layer does not include linear (long, relatively narrow) features; these are available in a separate map layer that portrays the locations of parkways and scenic rivers. Federal wilderness area information is included in this map layer and also in The National Map Small-Scale Collection National Wilderness Preservation System of the United States map layer. Indian lands, administered by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, are available in the Indian Lands of the United States map layer. _December 2014, December 2014, ~70.1 MB_
