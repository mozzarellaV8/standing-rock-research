### EIA Data Details

[**Crude Oil Pipelines**](CrudeOil_Pipelines_US_EIA) - Major crude oil pipelines in the United States. Layer includes interstate trunk lines and selected intrastate lines but excludes gathering lines. Based on publicly available data from a variety of sources with varying scales and levels of accuracy. This layer is not visible if zoomed in beyond 1:1,000,000 scale.

[**Crude Oil Rail Terminals**](CrudeOil_RailTerminals_US_EIA) - Rail terminals that handle the loading and unloading of crude oil.

[**Border Crossing, Liquids**](BorderCrossing_Liquids_EIA) - U.S. border crossing points of liquids pipelines. Liquids include crude oil, hydrocarbons, and petroleum products. This layer is not visible if zoomed in beyond 1:35,000 scale.
