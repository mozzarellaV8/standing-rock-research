# Data

I started collecting data on various topics, piecemeal, back in November 2016. And finally here now is a chance to organize it and make it available. Much of it is from publicly available (for now) sources, and every effort will be made to maintain proper provenance. 

While this may seem redundant to what is already available online, recent initiatives such as [Data Refuge](http://www.ppehlab.org/datarefuge) and the Environmental Data Governance Initiative ([EDGI](https://envirodatagov.org/)) have brought to light how tenuous these sources actually are, especially under the 2017 administration.


- [U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)](EIA) - e.g. crude oil pipelines, crude oil railways, HGL pipelines
- [Environmental Protection Agency](EPA)
- [U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)](USGS) - e.g. topographical maps - specifically of Standing Rock region, but the entire country is available. Really beautiful and high-resolution maps in PDF format, with some localities having multiple maps over time by the USGS release schedule (e.g. Detroit in 1913, Detroit in 1964)
- [Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration](PHMSA)
