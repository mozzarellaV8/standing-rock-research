# Standing Rock Research

Hi! 

This is a general repository for research topics, data, writing,and images - spawned from two trips I'd made out to Standing Rock in November 2016 and February 2017. After discussions with various people at camp and beyond, I decided to try to collect various findings into one place - here. 

Media has covered a lot of what happens day to day, and regardless of whether the camp physically exists the issues brought up by Standing Rock persist - be they cultural, environmental/scientific, legislative, or personal. 

The hope here is to continue developing better understanding of these issues, and to help further change and knowledge where it's necessary.

Suggestions and contributions are more than welcome - feel free to email me or create a new issue.
